             <h2>My name is Thamizh Bharathi and living simple life saved my life</h2>
             <p><strong>I used to be a pack rat </strong> . I had so many things that I thought I loved,but the truth was I couldn't appreciate any of them because there was too much</p>
             <p>Things were terrible. I had a job which I hated and a home that I didn't want to live in.</p>
             <h3>How I turned things around</h3>
             <p><strong>I was on the verge of breakdown when I got rid of everything</strong>.
                I literally put 90% of my possesions in garbage , sold my house and moved into a smaller appartment and i quit my job</p>
             <p>It wasn't easy at all but everything around me was bad in a such place, I didn't know what to do and slowly it worked.</p>
             <h3>Now I live the simple life</h3>
             <p>Now that's I am living a better life and, things are much better now, I'm less stressed and I got some extra time to play and think</p>
             <p>With how much it turned my life around ,<strong>I felt that I had no choice but to start sharing how I did it </strong> and how others can benefit from living a simple life as well, that's ehy I satrted this site</p>
